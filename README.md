### More info. {#Info-001}
FAQ
: Do we have a free will?
: My Response to that is - What if we (humans) are born with 99% capability of using our human brain,[^3565] and as we grow older we get further from that capability for the fact that humans develop there behaivor, personality, attitude based on their environment. so what if in the past we were one of the greatest being in the univers[^6383] but we got betrayed[^9090].and they decided to trap us by injecting everything we know today[^0001], thus making us what we are today. and now you might be thinking "how the heck did that answer the FAQ?!" well i think we do have[^0]
